This Project is used to initialize peripherals on STM32F072 without using HAl or LL Library. 
This project is designed to train my own understanding of how a (STM32) microcontroller is working.

The initial project was setup with STM32CubeIDE 1.3.0 but also works with newer versions of STM32CubeIDE (tested with v1.10.1).

It's still WIP.
